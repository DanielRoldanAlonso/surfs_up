## Overview

In this project, we are providing more information about temperature trends to W. Avy before opening the surf shop. This information specifically entails the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. If so, we will be able to start our business. 

## Results

- Based on both our temperature tables below, June will probably have a higher success in sales as the average temperature is higher than in December.
- From our December table, the lowest temperature of the month was  degrees which is less than 8 degrees from the lowest in June.
- Even though the lowest temperature for both months are very different, we can see that the highest tempereature for both is relatively the same wwith a difference of only 2 degrees.

## Summary

From our results we can conclude that in the month of June there will probably be more sales as the average temperature is higher and the lowest temperature is a difference of 8 degrees. However, the highest temperature for both months are relatively close which could lead to the same amount of success. To further determine if the surge and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, I would work on two more queries such as identifying the aveage temperature based on the time the shop would be open and investigate further the difference in count for December as that might affect its values.

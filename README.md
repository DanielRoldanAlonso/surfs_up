## Overview

In this project, we are providing more information about temperature trends to W. Avy before opening the surf shop. This information specifically entails the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. If so, we will be able to start our business.
